# Agent Version

Current: **agent-v1.0.0**

## Version Semantics

- **Major**: Breaking governance policy change (behavior change that can break existing project conventions)
- **Minor**: New governance rule added (new policy introduced, backward compatible)
- **Patch**: Text clarification / examples / formatting (no behavior change)

## Notes

Agent governance is tool-agnostic and has the highest priority in conflict resolution.
Skills under `/skills` are versioned independently.
