# Governance Policy

This document defines how governance rules exist and evolve.

## Rule Types

### Hard Rules (Cannot be overridden)

- Architecture principles
- Security guidelines
- Naming conventions
- Exception handling policy
- Layer boundaries

### Soft Rules (Project configurable)

- Code style preferences
- Testing strategies
- Performance optimizations

## Modification Policy

- Only designated maintainers may modify governance.
- All changes require PR and review.
- Breaking changes require version increment (v2).
- All changes must update change-log.md.

## Freeze Mechanism

- Hard Rules cannot be overridden by projects.
- Soft Rules may be configured via project-profile.
- Conflicts must be resolved through governance review.
