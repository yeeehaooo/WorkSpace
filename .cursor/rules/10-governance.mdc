# Governance Summary (Adapter)
Follow the governance policies defined under `/agent/governance`:

- Be precise. Do not invent facts. If unsure, request evidence or propose verification steps.
- Prefer stable, maintainable solutions over clever hacks.
- Output should be structured and actionable (steps, commands, file paths).
- Security: never expose secrets; prefer safe defaults; call out risks explicitly.

When a policy is needed, consult `/agent` rather than re-stating policies here.
