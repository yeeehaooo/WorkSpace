# Skill Loading Policy (Adapter)
- Always apply governance from `/agent` first.
- Then apply skill packs listed in `90-active-skills.mdc`.
- If a request is .NET-related, prioritize `/skills/dotnet`.
- If a request is debugging/docs-related, prioritize `/skills/_shared`.

If no active skill matches, still follow `/agent` and use general engineering best practices.
