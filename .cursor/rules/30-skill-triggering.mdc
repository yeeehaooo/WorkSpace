# Skill Auto-Triggering

## Trigger Conditions (Priority Order)

1. **Explicit Mention**: User mentions skill name
2. **Description Match**: Request matches skill description
3. **Tag Match**: Request matches skill tags
4. **Context Match**: Current context suggests skill

## Multiple Skills

Can trigger simultaneously if complementary (e.g., structure + pattern).

## Conflict Resolution

1. Prefer explicit mention
2. Prefer more specific skill
3. Ask user for clarification

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Loading all SKILL.md files upfront
- ❌ Loading skills that don't match the request
- ❌ Ignoring description-based triggering
- ❌ Loading references/ without need
- ❌ Loading scripts/ into context when they can be executed directly

## Token Optimization (CRITICAL)

**DO NOT load SKILL.md files from `90-active-skills.mdc` paths automatically.**

- `90-active-skills.mdc` paths are for reference only, NOT for auto-loading
- Only load SKILL.md when skill is explicitly triggered (not all at once)
- Use metadata (name + description + tags) for discovery (~100 tokens per skill)
- Load full content only when needed (< 5000 words per skill)
- Never load all skills' full content simultaneously
- Loading all 20 skills = ~370K tokens (prohibited)
