# Skill Metadata Registry

**CRITICAL: `90-active-skills.mdc` contains ONLY metadata. DO NOT load full SKILL.md files automatically.**

[Auto-generated from project-profile.json - metadata only (name + description + tags)]

**CRITICAL Loading Rules:**
- Paths in `90-active-skills.mdc` are for reference only, NOT for auto-loading
- DO NOT automatically load `/skills/{path}/SKILL.md` from listed paths
- Load full SKILL.md ONLY when skill is triggered by user request
- NEVER load all SKILL.md files upfront
- Use metadata for discovery, load body only when triggered

## Progressive Disclosure (Token Optimization)

Three-level loading to minimize token usage:

1. **Metadata Only** (~100 tokens/skill): name + description + tags
2. **SKILL.md Body** (triggered): Load only when skill matches request
3. **Resources** (explicit): Load references/scripts/assets only when needed

## External Claude Skills

External skills available on-demand (not in active skills list):
- Common: docx, pdf, pptx, xlsx, skill-creator, mcp-builder
- Load only when task matches skill description
