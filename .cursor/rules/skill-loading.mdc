- Only use skills located under `.cursor/skills` or `.claude/skills`.
- Do not assume existence of external skill systems.
- Load skills only when directly relevant to the task.
- Do not summarize or restate skill content.
- Convert skill guidance into concrete decisions.
- Avoid loading multiple skills unnecessarily.
