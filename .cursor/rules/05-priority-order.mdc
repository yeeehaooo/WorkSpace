# Rule Priority Order
1) `/agent/governance` and other `/agent/*` policies (highest priority)
2) Active skill packs listed in `90-active-skills.mdc`
3) Project-specific rules (if user opens a project repository in IDE, that repo's own `.cursor/rules` take effect)
4) Local overrides (lowest priority)

Never override governance silently. If a conflict exists, explain which rule wins and why.
